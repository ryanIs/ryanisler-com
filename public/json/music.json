Having wanted to make a Drum & Bass song for ages, I made this, and it turned out awesome. My favorite section is what I call the \"poly sect..\" It occurs after the melody comes in: a synthetic (faster) counter-melody plays a poly on top of the melody. Then it is manipulated into a new poly-rhythm, and finally, it's double layered (and panned a bit). I can't believe how totally \"redic\" it turned out.",
